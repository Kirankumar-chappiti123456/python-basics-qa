operator in python :

1.arithimetic operator:
1.addition=a+=5  ex:a=a+5;
2.subtraction=a-=5
3.division=a/=5
4.multiplication=*=5
5.modulus=%=5
6.exponentiation=a**=5
7.floor division=a//=5


assignment operators:


1.=
2.+=
3.-=
4.*=
5./=
%=
**=
//=
gate:
1.^=   exor
2.|=   or
3.&=   AND
4.>>= a>>=5
5<<=5 a<<=5 shift operator


relational operator: or comparsion :


1.== equal ex: a=4,b=5  : a==b is false
2.>   greater than a=5,b=4  : a>b is true 
3. <   lesser than a=4,b=5  : a<b is true
4.>= greater than equal to a=4,b=5; a>=b is true
5.<= lesser than equal to a=5,b=4 : a<=b is true 
6.!= not equal to a=3, b=5 :  a!=b is true 



logical operators:


1. AND    both are statements are true it returns true           ex: x=5 >> print(x>3 and x<10)     is true  
2. or      if one statement is true then only it is true          ex:x=5 >> print(x>3 and x<4)  is true if one statement is true than only is true 
3. not     it reverse the result and it shows the true             ex: x=5 print(not(x>3 and x<4)  is true .





identity operator : 
1. x is y          Returns True if both variables are the same object


ex :


x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x is z)

# returns True because z is the same object as x

print(x is y)

# returns False because x is not the same object as y, even if they have the same content

print(x == y)

# to demonstrate the difference betweeen "is" and "==": this comparison returns True because x is equal to y


2.is not 
Returns True if both variables are not the same object


ex:
x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x is not z)

# returns False because z is the same object as x

print(x is not y)

# returns True because x is not the same object as y, even if they have the same content

print(x != y)

# to demonstrate the difference betweeen "is not" and "!=": this comparison returns False because x is equal to y
